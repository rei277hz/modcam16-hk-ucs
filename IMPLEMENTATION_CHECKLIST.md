# Implementation checklist

## Documentation and contracts

- [x] Documentation defines display sources and RAW preparation at the XYZ-D65 boundary.
- [x] Document ACEScg/AP0 as scene-reference-only formats.
- [x] Document `inverse_from_xyz_d65` as the sole canonical inverse entry.
- [x] Document RGB→XYZ-D65 adapters and the DNG linear-1.0 reference-white policy.
- [x] Use Color trackpad and J′ trackwheel consistently for the related
      track-motion controls.
- [x] Check in the official post-November-2014 X-Rite 24-patch Lab D50 file
      with source, checksum, measurement, format, and active-subset metadata.
- [x] Document the 18 chromatic-patch UI subset and retain all six neutral
      patches in the provenance asset without adding UI dots.
- [x] Document direct CAT02 D50→ACES-white adaptation without ColorChecker
      RICD scaling, inverse ACES, or scene-side 203-nit placement.
- [x] Document the DNG ForwardMatrix and ColorMatrix camera-to-D50 branches
      separately from the common CAT02 D50→D65 application boundary.
- [x] Document Bradford for project-owned ICC PCS adaptations and CAT02 for
      project-owned non-ICC white-point boundaries, with the explicit DNG
      fallback and CAT16 exceptions.

## ACES source conversion

- [x] ACEScg preparation performs AP1→AP0 exactly once.
- [x] Preserve ACES2065-1/AP0 identity conversion.
- [x] AP0 is never interpreted as XYZ-D65.
- [x] Add regression coverage for primaries and neutral XYZ-D65 conversion.
- [x] Replace the project-owned D65↔ACES-white Bradford matrix pair with
      mutually inverse CAT02 matrices.

## Canonical inverse and scene paths

- [x] The canonical inverse implementation is `inverse_from_xyz_d65` and
      matches the official numerical behavior.
- [x] Supported display-referred RGB sources have RGB→XYZ-D65 adapters.
- [x] No inverse-from-ACEScg, inverse-from-AP0, or inverse-from-Rec.2020 entry
      points exist.
- [x] Direct scene-reference ACEScg and AP0 forward paths are available.
- [x] Ensure decomposition CPU paths call the native AP0 forward transform
      without an AP0→AP1→AP0 roundabout.
- [x] Mirror the native AP0 boundary in WebGPU/WGSL and remove its unused
      AP0/AP1 roundtrip matrices.
- [x] Expose forward target RGB for output clipping instead of converting
      XYZ→RGB→XYZ.
- [x] Retain the picker's intentional nonlinear inverse/forward reconstruction;
      it applies the selected ACES view's gamut mapping and is not a redundant
      color-space matrix roundabout.
- [x] Add same-profile conversion fast paths and complete the production
      A→B→A audit.
- [ ] Verify CPU/WASM/WebGPU parity after the direct-path changes.

## RAW/DNG

- [x] RAW decoding includes calibration, demosaicing, opcodes, and orientation.
- [x] Use a valid ForwardMatrix plus its required white-balance/calibration
      factors as the profile-defined camera→XYZ-D50 transform, and report it
      as used only when that transform succeeds.
- [x] Without a usable ForwardMatrix, use the ColorMatrix path with linear
      Bradford from the selected camera white to D50.
- [x] Apply the same CAT02 XYZ-D50→XYZ-D65 boundary after either DNG branch.
- [x] Preserve signed and above-one XYZ-D65 values without clamping.
- [x] Diagnostics, metadata, and source modes identify XYZ-D65.
- [x] Route DNG through inverse HDR Rec.2020 with linear 1.0 as reference white.
- [x] Force the DNG 2.03-encoded reference-white option unchecked and disabled.
- [x] Show helper text explaining the fixed DNG reference-white convention.
- [x] Use the same XYZ-D65 path for preview, loupe, and sampling.

## Image and EXR routing

- [x] Route ACEScg EXR through direct scene-reference ACEScg presentation.
- [x] Route ACES2065-1 EXR through direct scene-reference AP0 presentation.
- [x] Ensure scene-reference EXR bypasses inverse ACES and reference-white scaling.
- [x] Route display-referred RGB images through RGB→XYZ-D65 adapters.
- [x] Production display and analysis routing uses the XYZ-D65 boundary.
- [x] Adapt embedded ICC XYZ-PCS/D50 output to XYZ-D65 with Bradford.
- [x] Generate SDR ICC colorants and `chad` tags with Bradford.

## Tests

- [x] ACEScg conversion regression (no erroneous XYZ-D65 round trip).
- [x] Canonical inverse and adapter equivalence tests.
- [x] Scene-reference EXR tests proving inverse bypass.
- [x] DNG camera-neutral XYZ-D65 test.
- [ ] DNG signed/above-one preservation test.
- [x] DNG disabled-control UI test for the fixed linear-1.0 reference-white path.
- [ ] End-to-end DNG preview, loupe, sampling, and availability tests.
- [ ] CPU/WASM/WebGPU numerical parity tests for the direct AP0 paths.
- [x] Verify all 24 provenance records and exact mapping of the active 18 Lab
      D50 constants.
- [x] Verify direct CAT02 D50→ACES-white/AP1 conversion without an
      intermediate D65 ColorChecker adaptation.
- [x] Verify ICC PCS D50→D65 and generated ICC `chad` adaptations are
      Bradford.
- [x] Verify valid, absent, and invalid ForwardMatrix branches, including the
      common CAT02 final boundary and accurate diagnostics.
- [x] Verify ColorChecker uses direct CAT02-derived ACEScg targets without RICD
      or a calculated 203-nit scene gain.
- [x] Verify every ColorChecker API shares the same scene targets while
      preserving record layouts, patch order, dot availability, and snapping.

## ColorChecker scene targets

- [x] Centralize official Lab D50 patch data and the active 18-patch mapping.
- [x] Convert Lab D50→XYZ D50→CAT02-adapted ACES-white XYZ→ACEScg/AP1.
- [x] Do not apply RICD flare/scale or any separate scene gain.
- [x] Do not run ColorChecker patches through inverse ACES view transforms.
- [x] Update active normalized and legacy/public ColorChecker APIs to use the
      shared target helper.

## Consistency

- [x] Comments, names, and documents describe DNG as XYZ-D65.
- [x] Production inverse API names and source-mode strings match current routing.
- [x] Update the standalone ColorChecker tool, independent OCIO oracle, and
      user-facing README to match the adaptation policy.
- [x] Run Rust color-core tests, decomposition checks/WASM builds, TypeScript,
      OCIO, PNG/ICC, and the full browser/image-worker suite using Node from
      fnm. Native decomposition `cargo test` remains blocked by the repository's
      missing `src/wasm/decomposition/src/gpu_host_tests.rs` module.
